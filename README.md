# Cantonese Writer

Create Anki flashcard decks for learning Cantonese — stroke-order writing practice, Jyutping, Traditional characters, and native TTS audio.

A Cantonese adaptation of [Anki-xiehanzi](https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-xiehanzi).

**Live app:** https://joistad.github.io/cantonese-writer/

---

## What it does

- Look up Cantonese vocabulary from a built-in dictionary (CC-CEDICT + CantoJpMin)
- See Traditional Chinese characters with **Jyutping** romanisation and English definitions
- Export an Anki `.apkg` deck using the **Cantonese Writer** note type
- Cards include a **HanziWriter stroke-order practice field** — draw the character on screen and get it graded stroke by stroke
- Optional **Cantonese audio** via Google Cloud TTS (Hong Kong yue-HK voice — genuine Cantonese, not Mandarin)
- Tone colours follow the 6-tone Cantonese system

---

## How to use

2. Configure your deck (card layout, audio settings)

## Notes on character coverage

HanziWriter stroke data comes from [hanzi-writer-data](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer-data), which covers ~9,500 characters from Standard Chinese. A small number of **exclusively written-Cantonese characters** (e.g. 佢, 喺, 嘅, 咗) are not in that dataset — these show a graceful fallback message instead of a blank field. All other characters work normally.

## Tech stack

- Vanilla JS / HTML / CSS — no build step, runs entirely in the browser
- [genanki-js](https://github.com/krmanik/genanki-js) for `.apkg` generation
- [HanziWriter](https://hanziwriter.org/) for stroke-order animation and quiz
- [CantoJpMin](https://github.com/hanleyweng/CantoJpMin) for Jyutping lookup
- [CC-CEDICT](https://cc-cedict.org/) as the base dictionary
- Google Cloud TTS (yue-HK-Standard-A) for Cantonese audio
- [Anki Persistence](https://github.com/SimonLammer/anki-persistence) embedded in card templates
