# 寫粵字 Cantonese Xiehanzi

A Cantonese adaptation of [Xiehanzi](https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-xiehanzi) — a web app that generates Anki decks for practising Chinese character writing, adapted for **Cantonese** with Jyutping romanisation and Cantonese text-to-speech.

**Live app:** https://joistad.github.io/cantonese-xiehanzi/

---

## What it does

- Look up Cantonese vocabulary from a built-in dictionary (CC-CEDICT + CantoJpMin)
- See Traditional Chinese characters with **Jyutping** romanisation and English definitions
- Export an Anki `.apkg` deck using the **Anki-xiehanzi** note type
- Cards include a **HanziWriter stroke-order practice field** — draw the character on screen and get it graded stroke by stroke
- Optional **Cantonese audio** (Hong Kong neural voice via Edge TTS)
- Tone colours follow the 6-tone Cantonese system

---

## How to use

1. Open the [live app](https://www.perplexity.ai/computer/a/cantonese-xiehanzi-bYC.icAqTGy4h.zWnoy9YQ)
2. Search for a Cantonese word or character
3. Add words to your deck
4. Configure card options (Writing Component, Audio, Front side fields)
5. Click **Generate Deck** — downloads a `.apkg` file
6. Import the file into Anki

The cards use the `Cantonese-xiehanzi` note type (based on `Basic - (Anki-xiehanzi)`). If you already use the original Xiehanzi note type, the layout and functionality will be familiar.

## Notes on character coverage

HanziWriter stroke data comes from [hanzi-writer-data](https://github.com/chanind/hanzi-writer-data), which covers ~9,500 characters from Standard Chinese. A small number of **exclusively written-Cantonese characters** (e.g. 佢, 喺, 嘅, 咗) are not in that dataset and will not show a stroke-order practice field. All other characters work normally.
